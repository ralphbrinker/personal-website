            <h3>Starting with the Beginning in Mind</h3>

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                I explored this in-depth a while ago, but every time someone tries your product, there's a promise involved. We can also call it an expectation. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                A confrontation starts once the user sees the first interface. People will look for evidence that this is the place to get what they want to meet their expectations.
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                Very few of these folks will be after features. However, all of them want value, the thing that addresses their needs and pains.
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                That's why effective onboarding is about context and goals. Show users that the product handles their needs and solves their pain, and teach them at that precise moment how to achieve it.
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                Although onboarding flows start the conversation, they are usually part of the last stages of new products or releases. Sometimes, working on an onboarding flow leads to further discovery, so the team validates the reasons behind adopting a given feature.
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                That's why I decided from now on to start with the beginning in mind. Imagine if every new product or feature involves creating its onboarding flow or at least its empty state. It's the silver bullet that will make me talk to people, understand them, and know-how to present valuable things in a valuable way.
