            <h3>The Invisible Product is the Product</h3>

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                An orchestra is not the sound it produces, but how different musicians, with distinct specialties, articulate themselves to produce a result. Similarly, a technology product at its core is not the interfaces you manipulate, but the entities behind it and how they are combined to produce (hopefully) a coherent experience.
            </p>

                That lead to add an essential step to my workflow. Last November, I worked on a project, and the first thing I did was sit with the CEO and define all the pieces of the app and how they relate to each other. The whole process took a few days, and the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lfbWfYI=/">result</a> was fantastic.
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                <strong>Activation</strong><br>
                No confusion. No dead-ends. A few structural questions came up, but I had to do was to talk to my client about having this <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lfbWfYI=/">map</a> in front of us. I was able to deliver the whole app in six weeks (dark mode included!). The client is beyond happy, and I'll never put a single pixel on the screen before getting the right entities and their ideal arrangement to produce real music and not a bunch of incoherent noises.
