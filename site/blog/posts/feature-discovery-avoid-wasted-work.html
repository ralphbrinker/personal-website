        <h3>Feature Discovery: Avoiding Wasted Work</h3>
        <p class="blog__paragraph">It doesn't matter the features you have in your backlog. Every one of them is most likely based on assumptions. That's why, unless you're sure about the value a feature will bring and its format, you should start with feature discovery instead of feature development.</p>
        <p class="blog__paragraph">Assumption is a fancy name for risk, and you mitigate it only by collecting evidence. Here are some common assumptions that you need to back up with evidence:</p>

        <h4>We have a clear understanding of the problem</h4>

        <h4>We mapped the chain of events related to this problem <small>(the context involved)</small></h4>
        <h4>We know what the user experience of the solution should look like</h4>

        <h4>The customer will be able to understand and use the solution <small>(you'll only have this answer after you build and test a prototype with customers)</small></h4>
        <h4>We know how customers' success will be verified <small>(metrics)</small></h4>
        <p class="blog__paragraph">That's a starting point, but you could also consider other factors, anything that reduces the risk of developing anything detached from reality.</p>

        <figure class="blog__figure">
            <img class="blog__image" src="/assets/images/posts/feature-discovery-evidence.jpg" srcset="/assets/images/posts/feature-discovery-evidence@2x.jpg 2x" alt="Evidence" />
            <figcaption class="blog__figcaption">Collect evidence that connects you to real value on both ends: customer and business</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="blog__paragraph">Remember: you'll only be able to collect evidence with experiments and the shape of it can vary a lot. For example, if you need a better understanding of the problem, interview customers. If you want to be sure about the ideal format for the feature, put together a prototype, and test it.</p>
        <p class="blog__paragraph">In an ideal scenario, you'll put into production only features backed with evidence. Your end goal is to execute with minimal to no uncertainty.</p>

        <h5>Prioritizing</h5>
        <p class="blog__paragraph">Once you're done with feature discovery, you need to decide when to execute it. Again, your goal is to transform assumptions into concrete facts:</p>

        <h4>We know how much time, effort and resources this feature is going to require</h4>
        <p class="blog__paragraph">This should be easy, as you'll have a tested and validated prototype by now. So you and your team can understand the feature scope and all the specifications of it.</p>
        <p class="blog__paragraph">Finally, to decide how this is going to be prioritized, you should consider the impact the feature will have on both the business and the customers.</p>
        <p class="blog__paragraph">Our final assumptions:</p>

        <h4>The solution is valid once we see customer behavior (___) changing to (___)</h4>
        <h4>This behavior change will create (___) business value</h4>

        <p class="blog__paragraph">Define metrics and a time frame for the two parameters above and present it to the team and/or the CEO with everything done so far. It's quite a lot of work, but the big picture here will show:</p>
        <p class="blog__paragraph">a) Clear reasons why this should be put into production</p>
        <p class="blog__paragraph">b) A validated format, so everyone involved knows it will not be a waste of time</p>
        <p class="blog__paragraph">c) A precise effort and resource estimation. After all, we outlined the solution.</p>
        <p class="blog__paragraph">d) The value it brings and how to verify it</p>
        <p class="blog__paragraph">Stop wasting time in uncertain execution. Start investing time in feature discovery.</p>
