            <h3>Product Design is the Business of Improving Lives</h3>

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                Products exist to fix problems. But problems don't live in a vacuum. They're tied to people. If people have a problem, they are probably not happy with a particular aspect of their lives. So, products exist to improve people's lives.
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                But, the thing is, you need to know how you're improving someone's life. That's when you look for evidence that shows how the product is making people's lives better. Each evidence demands specific things that need to happen. Either you require users to change their perception or update their skillset. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                You affect perception when you remind users about the context and how what you're asking them will generate progress towards a better life. You affect their skillset by lowering the learning curve or improving motivation, which is related to perception.
