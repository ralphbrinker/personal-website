            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                A client will tell me about the business goals. Its users will reveal the problems they face. By researching competitors and other similar products, I'll have an idea about the usual solutions.
            </p>
            
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                I might go beyond and expand the discovery process to unrelated fields. My imagination could take me to exciting places, but I would still be counting with luck to understand what is possible. Sometimes, my luck meets reality when the engineering team tells me that what I planned is not feasible.
            </p>
            
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                Now reimagine what I just described, but now the engineers entered the scene early on. They are inspired by the future the product will bring to life. They know the most critical problems to tackle. It's also clear which behaviors need to be affected, the context in which the result of their work will live, and the benefits it will bring to real people.
            </p>
            
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                Instead of being the ones who bring me back to a reality of limitations, they will be the ones pushing what's possible.
