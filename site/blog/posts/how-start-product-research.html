            <h3>How I Start Product Research</h3>

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                A product starts with an idea, an insight into how something could be better. If something has room to improve, then there's a problem involved. So, in reality, a product answers a problem.
            </p>
            
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                The first research is the one that helps validate or invalidate this problem. So here's what I try to cover:
            </p>

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                • Who experiences this problem? <em>This reveals the potential audience that will care the most for my solution.</em>
            </p>
            
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                • What's the history behind it? Where does it start? <em>The answer for this one allows me to build a user journey so that I understand the problem within a context</em>
            </p>
            
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                • What's the cost of it? <em>If I know the time, money, stress, or anything that this problem causes, that will be how I start future conversations with potential users. Or even invalidate the problem if people don't experience relevant pain there.</em>
            </p>
            
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                • How are these people solving or trying to solve this problem? <em>So I understand solutions that are at least valid, uncover valuable patterns, and even find a price point for my solution and set my expectations accordingly</em>
            </p>
            
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                Since this is highly exploratory, I try to talk to at least 20 people, mainly because you might end up talking to folks who don't care that much about the problem.
            </p>
