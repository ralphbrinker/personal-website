            <h3>First Steps Uncovering the Problem Space</h3>

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                All I need to start running research is to remember that any product answers a problem. The first step then is making it tangible, stating the problem within a context, and finding people who experience the problem. 
            </p>

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                The problem statement can be lengthy, but I do my best to summarize it in one or two sentences. I start by asking: "What pops into your mind when you hear: [problem statement]". I observe their reaction, ask them to tell me stories related to it. My goal is to investigate the related pain, needs, and goals.
            </p>
            
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                During the interview, I do my best to identify the problem-related pieces. Once the subject is exhausted, I explore each: "What have you mentioned [piece]? How does it affect you?"
            </p>
            
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                One of two things happens: the problem is not relevant enough, or there's something there, and I need to revisit my problem statement. Notice that getting it right at first is not even an option. It takes time to refine the problem space. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                It might seem too much time to invest so early in product development, but try the alternative: to rebuild the solution because the targeted problem was not there.
            </p>
