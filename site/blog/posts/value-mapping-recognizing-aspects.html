            <h3>Value Mapping Starts by Recognizing its Key Aspects</h3>

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                Not much imagination is needed to think about value for a company. Mainly, it will circle increasing existing and new business, decreasing costs, or improving shareholder value, making the company more likely to thrive for a long time. A business survives based on those goals.
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                However, value for customers is way more diverse. Listing the possibilities would hurt any effort of uncovering them. Instead, it might be more helpful to understand four aspects of it:
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                <strong>Value is perception.</strong> What I believe is valuable might even be for customers as well, but do they perceive it the same way? Maybe they use different words for it. It might be a good idea to adopt their point of view and build on it.
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                <strong>Value is emotional.</strong> What I think is valuable is always tied to emotions. Besides the most practical aspects, how does this value connects to emotions like fear, anxiety, and happiness?
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                <strong>Value is contextual.</strong> What I assume is value needs to be part of a narrative that allows me to understand its actual weight, the pain it relieves, the satisfaction it brings.
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                <strong>Value is tied to hidden costs.</strong> The context mentioned above should expand the concept of cost. Value is related to saving time, reducing effort, lowering stress, and anything else that makes people's lives better.
