            <h3>Two Questions that Connect Product and Marketing</h3>

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                Product people are primarily concerned about creating the right product for people who want and can use it. The latter makes most of their days. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                Designers create interfaces using known patterns. They build prototypes that validate (or not) our assumptions. They focus on bringing the product's power under a logical and straightforward interaction pattern so that people can use our creation.
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                So, one question is: <strong>"Will the users be able to use the product?"</strong>. It's about the designer's ability to balance features, industry patterns, and familiar patterns (to that user segment).
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                Marketing people spend much time uncovering the reasons behind a product's adoption and finding people who should care about it. So, in essence, they ask themselves: <strong>"Will the user want to use the product?"</strong>. Also, they translate the product's outcomes into words that fit the user's needs and goals.
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                Designers build better products when having the right people as their focus to iterate on. Marketers will attract the right audience they see in real-time the product effectively solving a given range of problems.
            </p>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
                It all starts with two questions that lead to a much valuable collaboration between Product and Marketing.
