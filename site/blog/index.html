                            People pay attention to your product because of a
                            promise. You told them to expect more speed,
                            productivity, or better status. You guarantee that
                            all they need to do is to join you.

                        <p class="blog__paragraph">
                            It doesn't matter the features you have in your
                            backlog. Every one of them is most likely based on
                            assumptions. That's why, unless you're sure about
                            the value a feature will bring and its format, you
                            should start with feature discovery instead of
                            feature development.

                        <p class="blog__paragraph">
                            Assumption is a fancy name for risk, and you
                            mitigate it only by collecting evidence. Here are
                            some common assumptions that you need to back up
                            with evidence:

                        <h3>Principles on Effective Onboarding</h3>
                        <p class="blog__paragraph">
                            Onboarding is not about your company. It has nothing
                            to do with making users complete their profile or
                            asking them to invite their friends. It's about
                            their success, how they will reach their goals
                            through your product. Onboarding is the best way for
                            them to experience the value you promised. So, it's
                            not only a matter of knowing how to use it, but how
                            to use it to reach their goals.
                        </p>
                        <p class="blog__paragraph">
                            It's about producing evidence of success, samples of
                            it, small victories, and it's your responsibility,
                            not the user's to make that happen. So, forget about
                            tutorials, manuals or even your website FAQ. You do
                            need onboarding. However, not just any kind, but the
                            right kind.
                        </p>
                        <p class="blog__paragraph">
                            Some companies do it as a tour of their core
                            features. They give the user several visual clues,
                            highlighting controls. That's not enough. It's not
                            about knowing how things work, but how they'll work
                            to serve users.
                        </p>
                        <p class="blog__paragraph">
                            Other companies structure their onboarding flow with
                            tasks in mind. Each task has a series of steps, and
                            the user is guided to perform each one of them.
                            Better, but still not the ideal.
